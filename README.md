## FAQ
### Booting the installer
After having created the installer USB flash drive, you are ready to install macOS on your Vostro. Make sure SSD mode is set to AHCI mode instead of RAID in BIOS otherwise, macOS won't be able to detect your SSD. Select your USB flash drive as boot media and go through the macOS installer like you would on a real mac. Once you have come to the desktop, advance to the next step.

### Post Installation
Congratulations! You have successfully booted and installed macOS. At this point, you just have to copy the EFI folder you have prepared in a previous step to the SSD. Mount the EFI partition of your SSD with

`sudo diskutil mount disk0s1`

and copy your customized EFI folder into the newly mounted EFI partition. You should now be able to boot your computer without the USB flash drive attached. If you're having issues with specific parts like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or Audio, have a look at the corresponding sections in this repository and open an issue if you are unable to solve them.

## üõ† Hardware
This section talks about configuring the EFI folder for your exact hardware.

Almost all changes are done inside the OpenCore configuration file. I strongly recommend using either [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) or Xcode to edit `EFI/OC/config.plist`.

### üîà Audio
Without any modifications, the headphone jack is buggy. External microphones aren't detected and the audio output may randomly stop working or start making weird noises. Sometimes un- and replugging the headphones works, but that's pretty annoying and unreliable. To permanently fix this issue you will have to install [this fork of ComboJack](https://github.com/lvs1974/ComboJack).

Cause I've added this kext in EFI folder so you don't need to add it anymore.

+ Guide :
1. Run ComboJack_Installer/install.sh in terminal and reboot
2. Done. When you attach a headphone there will be a popup asking about headphone type.

### üîã Power management
Hibernation is not supported on a Hackintosh and everything related to it should be completely disabled. Disabling additional features prevents random wakeups while the lid is closed. After every update, these settings should be reapplied manually.

```
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
sudo rm -f /var/vm/sleepimage
sudo mkdir /var/vm/sleepimage
sudo pmset -a standby 0
sudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0
sudo pmset -a powernap 0
sudo pmset -a proximitywake 0
sudo pmset -b tcpkeepalive 0 (optional)
```

For the best power management it's recommended to disable CFG lock and let macOS do the power management. Follow [this guide](https://github.com/jaromeyer/XPS9570-Catalina/issues/44#issuecomment-708540167) to do so. For more information about CFG lock, have a look [here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/misc/msr-lock.html).

### Why there is RestrictEvent kext in EFI, what does it means?
RestrictEvent is a kext that help bypass MacOS limitations, in our case it prevents the device from random freezing.

### I have a Samsung PM981 SSD, will it work?
The Samsung PM981 (or more precise the controller it uses) is known to cause random kernel panics in macOS. Up until now, there was no way to even install macOS on the PM981 and the only option was to replace it with either a SATA3 SSD.
